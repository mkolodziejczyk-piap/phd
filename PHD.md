## Environment

Urban challenging terrain, indoor and outdoor, defense/military scenario, e.g. multi-floor buildings with stairs, warehouses, industrial spaces, etc. possibly damaged by exposion

## Manouvers

* moving up/down stairs
* climbing up/down largre obstacle
* traversing large gap
* crawling under obstacle

(all a

with manipulator force control
* door opening
* pushing object

## Inputs

* goal pose (e.g. a pose selected on map)
* current state estiamtion of robot
* current map

## Modules

* Perception: elevation map generation
* Higher level navigation module - is planning intermediate poses (possibly with velocities)
* Lover level locomotion module - is planning direct command to robot actuators

## Algorithms

* Reinforcement learning, in particular hierarchical reinforcement learning, possibly with expert demonstration
* Perception algorithms to generate map

## Sim-to-real

* building simulationn environment with ability to genereate diverse scenarios
* training in simulation in large scale
* building real environment (e.g. safety belts)
* sim-to-real transfer
